//! Domain model for a single research substrate artifact.
//!
//! `Artifact` is the central type in this crate. Every other module either
//! produces `Artifact`s (parse, index) or operates on them (filter).
//!
//! Key differences from `work-view-core`'s `Item`:
//! - No `id` field — research artifacts have no mandatory identifier.
//! - No `stage` field — the research tier has no draft→review→done pipeline.
//! - No `kind`/`tags`/`parent`/`depends_on` — tier is derived from directory,
//!   not frontmatter.
//! - `identity` is a computed fallback: `source_handle ∥ slug ∥ file stem`.
//! - `corpus` is derived from `reference/<corpus>/` path; `None` elsewhere.
